### My active projects

> [Kawaii](https://github.com/ItzMoon931/Kawaii) **(Trojan.Win32)**
* This is my first public malware, I made another one but it's such a total shit that I decided not to publish it, this malware is destructive, causing MBR modification, corrupted registers, icon changes, windows boot file deletion and file changes throughout System32, but the most interesting are the GDIs as there are several such as BitBlt or PlgBit.
